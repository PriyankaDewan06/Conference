### Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method that is used for building machine learning models where the dependent variable is dichotomous: i.e. binary. Logistic regression is used to describe data and the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The independent variables can be nominal, ordinal, or of interval type.

The name “logistic regression” is derived from the concept of the logistic function that it uses. The logistic function is also known as the sigmoid function. The value of this logistic function lies between zero and one.

### How Does the Logistic Regression Algorithm Work?
Consider the following example: An organization wants to determine an employee’s salary increase based on their performance.

For this purpose, a linear regression algorithm will help them decide. Plotting a regression line by considering the employee’s performance as the independent variable, and the salary increase as the dependent variable will make their task easier.
